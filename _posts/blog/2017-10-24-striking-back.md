Wow! I am ashamed of myself about letting so many days in between entries. I have been very busy mainly with two things.

1.- The Udacity artificial intelligence Nanodegree. It has been a challenge to me. Not only I had many new concepts to deal with, but also I had to update my coding skills. I am about to start the last project of the first term and I am willing to finish it during this week. I will do a review of the first term in an article as soon as I am finished.  I just will say as a sneak peek for everyone interested that I do recommend to have a solid knowledge of Python. I already did some courses on Udemy but it was not enough to deal with the solutions on the Nanodegree. So, I concurrently studied all the possible courses available on DataCamp.

2.- Job interviews. Since mid-August the job market has been growing fast on possibilities for Data Scientist. After my Deep Learning Nanodegree and while doing the AI ND, I have seen much more possibilities in which I can be a good match. My work on the portfolio was crucial for some of the interviews. And I can feel that my confidence is much higher after so much studying, coding and as well as a result of the many interviews I have done in the last months. I did manage to have some offers, but I did need to reject them. Either the job position was not being a data analyst or scientist, or they were looking for a junior according to the salary offers.

So, I am on the track and I hope sooner than later I can open a champagne bottle that I keep in the fridge for celebrations.
