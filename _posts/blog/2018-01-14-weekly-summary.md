This week has been weak in terms of Data science dedication.

The reason is that I recently started a personal project . Therefore Most of my free hours (up to 30h) was used to learn new skills for it. Despite that, I still spent some time to the core of this blog. And that log is the weekly summary.

As It has been common for the last months I have dedicated some time to refresh my coding skills and learn new packages. As a result, this week I finished the following [DataCamp][311043ca] courses:

- Introduction to the Tidyverse with R.
- Spatial Analysis in R with sf and raster.

And I have started this one,

- Spatial Statistics in R

I did continue my reading of book by LinkedIn influencer [**Brigette Tasha Hyacinth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brigettehyacinth/) titled
[The Future of Leadership: Rise of Automation, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence](http://amzn.to/2CJGsv5).

I also have some advances on my course on Computer Vision with open CV at [Udemy][f8422003].

I started some aside new scripts using R. I am not sure if this projects will become a portfolio item or I will use them just for fun. Time will say.

And that's it. In total, I put an effort on DS of more than 12 hours this week.
