Let's start this blog honestly. Until just some months ago I had no idea of data science, data analysis, machine learning or another fantasy concept that I will talk about you on this blog.

I worked all my professional life in Finance. Treasury, Reporting, accounting, are among my areas of expertise. After more than 15 years working on that, I decided to turn a twist and study data analysis. I did it through a school where you learn by doing. I learned from scratch all these concepts that I have named above and many more. I learned to code in R and to transform business questions to analytical processes and finally to final conclusions.

But beyond all that I learned, I opened the lid of a treasure chest. The chest of illusion and learning. So I have opened this blog so that you can come with me along this way.Â Shall you?
